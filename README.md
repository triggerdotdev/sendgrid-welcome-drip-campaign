## ‚ú® Trigger.dev Welcome Drip Campaign with SendGrid

This repo contains a [customEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events) Trigger that will send an example drip email campaign using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

```ts
import { customEvent, Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import * as sendgrid from "@trigger.dev/sendgrid";
import { z } from "zod";

new Trigger({
  id: "sendgrid",
  name: "SendGrid",
  // Trigger on a custom event, see https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events
  on: customEvent({
    name: "new.user",
    // Use zod to verify event payload. See https://docs.trigger.dev/guides/zod
    schema: z.object({ id: z.string(), email: z.string(), name: z.string() }),
  }),
  // The run functions gets called once per "new.user" event
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // Send the initial welcome email. See https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/sendgrid/actions/mail-send
    await sendgrid.mailSend("send-welcome-email", {
      from: {
        // Your 'from' email needs to be verified in SendGrid. https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity
        email: "john@acme.dev",
        name: "John from the Acme Corporation",
      },
      personalizations: [
        {
          to: [
            {
              name: event.name,
              email: event.email,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      subject: "Welcome to the Acme Corporation!",
      content: [
        {
          // This can either be text/plain or text/html, text/html in this case
          type: "text/html",
          value: `<p>Hi ${event.name},</p>

<p>Thanks for signing up to the Acme Corporation. </p>

      ],
    });

    await ctx.waitFor("‚è≤", { hours: 1 });

    // Send the follow up email
    await sendgrid.mailSend("send-follow-up-email", {
      // Your 'from' email needs to be verified in SendGrid. https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity
      from: {
        email: "john@acme.dev",
        name: "John Doe",
      },
      personalizations: [
        {
          to: [
            {
              name: event.name,
              email: event.email,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
      subject: "How are you finding the Acme Corporation?",

## üß™ Test it

After successfully running this template locally, head over to your [Trigger.dev Dashboard](https://app.trigger.dev) and you should see your newly created workflow:

![workflow overview](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/d87d58e5-b5d6-4032-2ece-4c4d20c23100/public)

Click on the "Test your workflow" button and fill in the JSON needed for [this workflow's](src/index.tsx#L14) customEvent Trigger:

![workflow test](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/4c6f0510-80dd-49dd-93d4-1087e13f8700/public)

After click "Run Test" you'll be redirected to the Run Details page and you should see a prompt for entering your SendGrid API Key:

![api key 1](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/0708d833-65c2-415e-4eab-13d9dcb70900/public)

![api key 2](https://imagedelivery.net/3TbraffuDZ4aEf8KWOmI_w/428b0e00-6de4-4e5d-567b-6ae0cb037500/public)

After hitting "Save" the Run will pickup where it left off and make the request to SendGrid to send your email:

## üì∫ Go Live

After you are happy with your campaign and deploy it live to Render.com (or some other hosting service), you can send custom events that Trigger your workflow using the [sendEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/reference/send-event) function from the `@trigger.dev/sdk`, or simply by making requests to our [`events`](https://docs.trigger.dev/api-reference/events/sendEvent) API endpoint.

Here is an example of sending the custom event to trigger the workflow contained in this repo using `fetch`:

```ts
const eventId = ulid();
const event = {
  name: "new.user",
  payload: {
    id: "user_1234",
    email: "eric@trigger.dev",
    name: "Eric",
  },
};

const response = await fetch("https://app.trigger.dev/api/v1/events", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: eventId,
    event,
  }),
});
```
